## API key setup

- Get your API keys from [NASA](https://api.nasa.gov/).
- Make a `.env` file in the root of the project and add the api key to the `API_KEY` variable. (Refer the example.env file already present in the repository) . The reason for this is that the API key is confidential and already added to gitignore so that it wont get pushed to github.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Contributing

- Refer this [Contributing.md](https://github.com/parthpanchal123/antariksh/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) file for the guidelines for contributing to the project.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
